```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
plot(x, y)
```


```{r}
summary(x)

there are a number of options for the output or the chunk that you include directly in the chunck space, for example I used a different size for the graph, but it will only be visible in the source code

```{r, fig.width= 4, fig.height= 4}
#this is a comment
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
plot(x, y)
```
